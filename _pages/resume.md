#### Projects
- **Cornell Baja Racing Half-shaft & Constant Velocity Joints**:  
  *The half-shaft and constant velocity joint system allow for torque to be transmitted from the driveline to the wheels throughout the cars suspension travel*  
  - Reduce half-shaft weight by 50% by optimizing materials, and geometry with specially gun drilling process
  - Analyze 7075 aluminum constant velocity plunging cups with FEA to achieve FoS > 3 and accounted for fatigue life > 10^6 cycles

- **Chadwick Robotics System Design**:  
  *Team lead for a team that designs and builds a robot to compete in the high school VEX Robotics Competition*  
  - Create 400+ page engineering notebook documenting entire design process
  - Utilize Ansys Discovery CFD to model flying game elements to inform system design.
  - Used OnShape CAD to design full robot assembly for the teamâ€™s turret-bot. Created custom spur gears for turret base and a custom ring gear for a planetary gear set.
  - CAM & machined gears on desktop CNC router and manufactured custom motor spline with manual mill and lathe.
  - Used Autodesk Inventor to design holonomic x-drive to allow movement in any direction on the playing field optimizing for autonomous driving points. 
  - Program autonomous driving by creating control system diagrams and implementing inverse motor model & PID in C++
