MAE 2250 Original Design Project (ODP) where a team of 5 people identify a problem and work through the prototyping design process. Starting off with problem research by interviewing potential customers focusing on what their needs are in the specific problem area we focused on. Our chosen problem space is how college students will often have caffeinated canned beverages, but wont finish them in one sitting. This makes it really easy to spill the drink walking between classes.

Once we had identified the issue we where trying to tackle we worked on brainstorming ideas, features and designs to accomplish the goal. After collecting many ideas—some more practical than others— we moved on to the initial CAD phase.

We landed on a design that would fit snugly around a can with internal tappers so that it would fit universally with many can designs. It would secure onto the can by an external nut locking the can cap into place.

We choose to make a spinning lid that still resembled the iconic can lid look that could be rotated as to seal off the main drinking hole. This lid was 3D printed out of TPU for its rubber like properties to abide in sealing and since it is a food safe material. We implemented an O-ring on the primary body of the Can Cap to ensure sealing from the can body to the cap.
