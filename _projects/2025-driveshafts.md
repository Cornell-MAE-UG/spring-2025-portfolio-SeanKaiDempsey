My project for Cornell Baja Racing 2024-2025 was to design the driveshafts and plunging cups for our 2025 car, TG21. This part had a lot of potential for weight savings since TGXX's driveshafts where designed to be carbon fiber bonded, but failed under testing leaving us using solid stainless steel shafts weight 2.93 lbs per shat. This left a lot of opportunities to reduce weight.

I looked a wide range of materials and manufacturing techniques to weight reduce this part. I created an engineering design trade table weighting potential weight savings, packaging, manufacturability and costs. The prevailing solution was to gun drill a high strength heat treated steel because it resulted in a 58% weight reduction.

In addition to the driveshafts I designed the our custom plunging cups that integrate into both the front and rear gearboxes. The primary challenge with the plunging cups is working with the suspension geometry designer to ensure proper clearances as the plunging components go though their range of travel. On the inboard side the plunging cups need to interface with the gearbox and drivetrain packaging requirements.
