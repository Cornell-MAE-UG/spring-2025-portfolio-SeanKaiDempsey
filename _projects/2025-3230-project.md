MAE 3230 Fluid Mechanics Dissection video. I primarily worked on the pipe and heater section working on the hand calcs to show the speed of the fluid through the pipe. I  contributed to the fan section where I worked with the team to understand how the fan functioned with the rest of the humidifier system. We knew that the blower fan was a radial flow turbomachine, but we weren't sure how the airfoils worked. We discovered that it was a forward curved centrifugal fan which when then was able to use that knowlage to understand how the trubomachine worked. I worked on taking measurements of the critical components to use in the calculations. I also edited the video in iMovie.
