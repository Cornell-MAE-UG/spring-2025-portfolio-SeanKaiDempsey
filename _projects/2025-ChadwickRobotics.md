Robotics is clearly one of Sean’s primary passions. During the school shutdowns of 2020, Sean singlehandedly designed, constructed, and successfully qualified for the VEX World’s Championship – all from the confines of the family garage. The following year, Sean, as team captain, repeated that performance with a win of the “Build Award” for the design at the California state championships.

This award was based primarily on the design process documented in the notebook / thesis, which detailed the research, design iterations. Winning this awarded qualified the team to travel compete in the worlds championships against teams across the globe. 

As a high school senior Sean committed to pushing the limits of the VEX robotics system by designing a turret bot with auto aim systems for scoring flying game elements.

Doing this required out of the box thinking to design and manufacture custom components such as a custom turret base gear and custom ring gears all within competition legal parts. 

In order to accomplish turret auto aiming custom control systems had to be designed which implemented an electro-dynamic inverse motor model paired with a PID controller. 

After great success with the engineering notebook in the previous competition season significant emphasis was placed on the engineering notebook. You can take a look at the engineering notebook [here]({{ "/assets/2150A-SpinUp-Digital-Notebook-2022-2023.pdf" | relative_url }}) in PDF format.
